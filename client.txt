Just for the sake of authorization I decided to go with Auth0 just to have a little bit of authorization in the app. I thought about using redux to save state but decided since the app was basically a single page that there was no need to go into that. I wanted the user to be presented with a list of images and then select from a list of names in a dropdown menu. I thought about validating the user's selection when choosing from the dropdown but decided against that because it could be an accidental selection instead of intentional. To solve that I added a validate button instead. When the user clicks this button it will make a request to the API and compare the id with the image headshot id. If the match is correct then a green thumbs up icon will pop up to acknowledge their choice was correct and if they choose incorrectly a red thumbs down icon will pop up. The application also keeps a count of the number of incorrect and corret answers chosen by the user. If they refresh the list these values will return to 0. I also added an option that would let the user choose the number of faces and names that they wanted to compare.
